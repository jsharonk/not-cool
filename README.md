# not-cool
modified whack-a-mole game to practice speaking up

#javascript30 's last challenge is a whack-a-mole game

the thing is/
what do i have against moles?/
nothing, really.
so why am i whacking them?/

something i do want to practice, however, is 
saying something when i see/hear something/
being slow of mind and speech,
i often think of the retort i wanted to say/
six hours later/
i don't want this to be the case /
if i hear someone saying something that just isn't right /
i'd like to be able to say 'not cool' /
immediately /
involuntarily /
would that stop that person from saying any such things in the future?
maybe not /
but it would have made a difference if i had heard someone stick up for me /
when i heard it said to me /
and for that, i need to practice.

i made a SVG of something people have said to me /
and i'd pretend not to hear it /
but these days, if i hear it being said to someone else /
i hope to be able to speak up and say /
'not cool'
