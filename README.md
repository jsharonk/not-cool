# not-cool
modified whack-a-mole game to practice speaking up

#javascript30 's last challenge is a whack-a-mole game

the thing is
what do i have against moles?
nothing, really.
so why am i whacking them?

something i do want to practice is 
to say something when i see something
being slow of mind and speech,
i often think of the retort i wanted to say
six hours later
i don't want this to be the case if i hear someone saying something that just isn't right
i'd like to be able to say 'not cool'
immediately
involuntarily
and for that, i need to practice

i made a SVG of something i used to hear said to me
and i'd pretend not to hear it
but these days, if i hear it being said to someone
i hope to be able to speak up and say
'not cool'
